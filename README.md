## Notes

This project was built with minimal library usage ‚Äî only MUI and React Query (TanStack) were included ‚Äî to maintain a focus on core React and JavaScript fundamentals.

I typically work with TypeScript in production projects, but since it wasn't listed as a requirement (at least I didn't see it), this solution uses plain JavaScript and CSS modules. 

I'd also normally use some quality-of-life libraries like Axios, Formik, and Jotai, but I felt raw JavaScript / React was the best call here.
